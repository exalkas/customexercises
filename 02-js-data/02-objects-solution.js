        The horse would have been trampled to pieces,
        
        And the men who would have been killed, and the whole town would have been burned.
        
        But I have been there, and we are done, for the king has gone forward,
        
        And if he is still in front of us, it says that it is time for him to see it again.
        
        Now let us come back to the place,
        
        For our own sake I will take an oath.
        
        Then shall we come back and lay hands on their bodies,
        
        And all that has no other will be eaten
        
        And there will be a thousand thousand more people to be massacred.
        
        Now let us go and lay hands on theirs.`,
