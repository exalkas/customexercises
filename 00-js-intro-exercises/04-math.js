/**
 * Exercise 01
 * Write a function hypotenuse that calculates the length of the hypotenuse
 *  of a right triangle. 
 * The length of the hypotenuse is calcultaed from this formula: 
 * a² + b² = c². 
 * Since 3² + 4² = 5² applies, hypotenuse(3, 4) should return 5.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 02
 * Write a function midrange, that calculates the midrange of 3 numbers. 
 * The midrange is the mean of the smallest and largest number.
 * Example: midrange(3, 9, 1) should return (9+1)/2 = 5
 */

/**
 * Exercise 03
 * Write a function area that calculates the area of a circle. 
 * The function is given the radius of the circle.
 * Example: area(1) should return π and area(2) should return 4 * π

/**
 * Exercise 04
 * Write a function dice that returns a random number between 1 and 6 like in dices
 */

 /**
  * Exercise 05
  * Write a function round100 that rounds a number to the nearest hundred.
  * Example: round100(1749) should return 1700 and round100(856.12) should return 900
  */

 /**
  * Exercise 06 Attention: Loops and conditional are required
  * Write a function parseFirstInt that takes a string and returns the first integer present in the string. 
  * If the string does not contain an integer, you should get NaN.
  * Example: parseFirstInt('No. 10') should return 10 and parseFirstInt('Babylon') should return NaN
